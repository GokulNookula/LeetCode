'''Explained: Time Complexity: O(O(4 N/Sqrt(N)) Space Complexity: O(n)
We basically use backtracking where we use a stack to append our current combination of
parentheses and once we are completed with the combination we append it into the result.
Fisrt we make a base case where we check if the number of open parentheses and closed parentheses
are equal to n. If so then we start appending the result into the stack by making an empty string first
and joining it so we result our answer as a string. Next we need to make a case where we check if number of
open parentheses is less than n and if so we append one into the stack and we call backtrack and increment the
count of open parentheses and we also make sure we pop the character out from the stack after adding it. Next
we need to make another case to check if our closed parentheses count is less than open parentheses as we cannot
have closed parentheses count aka appended before the open and if so we append it into the stack and increment
the count and call backTrack and we also make sure to pop it out of the stack. Now finally we need to also make the
base case of starting the backTrack algorithm. And finally we return our result.
