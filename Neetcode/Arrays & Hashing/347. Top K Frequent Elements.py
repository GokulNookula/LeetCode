Explained: Time Complexity: O(n) Space Complexity: O(n)
We basically use bucket sort where the count number is the buckets.
The number of buckets is the max size of the array aka freq in the code.
Then we store a dictionary of keys aka numbers which have the same count.
The first for loop does that where if not in the Hashmap it gives it a value of 1
and also it increases the value aka count by 1 if it already exists.
The second for loop is basically appending the values into the correct buckets
Then the third for loop basically checks from the max count bucket to the minimum one
and adds the K number of Frequency numbers into the result array and returns it if 
len(res) == k.

'''
Explained: Time Complexity O(n log(k)) and Space Complexity O(n)
We are basically taking a huge list of elements and making a for loop and
check if element exists in the HashTable or not and if it doesnt give it
a starting count value and if it exists then we increase the count.
The heap part basically goes through the array and finds the nlargest
values and returns it from the Hash Table.
