'''Explained: Time Complexity: O(n) and Space Complexity: O(1)
In this problem we use the solution of Floyd's cycle algorithm aka Hare and Tortoise algorithm
where we initalize two pointers called slow and fast and next in the while loop we check if
our current fast pointer is pointing to null pointer and if fast.next is pointing to null pointer
which means we are at the end of the list and that we did not find a cycle this ending the algorithm.
Next if there is a cycle we move slow pointer by 1 node and fast pointer by 2 pointers and according to
Floyd's algorithm no matter what these pointers will always meet sometime. Thus we iterate and if 
slow and fast pointer are pointing to the same point then there is a cycle thus we return True or else
we exit our while loop and return False.
