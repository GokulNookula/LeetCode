'''Explained: Time Complexity: O(n) Space Complexity: O(n)
We first make a dictionary called count where we store all the characters we find while parsing through the entire string. We
initalize the left pointer to the beginning of the array. We initalize the result variable to store the longest character sequence along with
the replacements being equal to or under k. We also initalize a variable called maxf which store the maximum frequency character from the dictionary.
Next we make a for loop and increment the right pointer. In here, we must check if the current character in the right pointer is alredy inside the 
dictonary then we just increase it's count by 1 while also doing coun.get() to get the latest count or else we set it to 0 and increment it by 1
to initalize it. Next we need update the maximum frequency character value from the hashmap everytime to keep track of the largest count frequency.
Next if we find that the right pointer is a different character from the max frequency character then we need to perform windowlen - maxf and if that
value is greater than k aka the replaceable characters if it is not then we skip the while loop or else we decrement the count of the character at the
left pointer aka move it by 1 to fit our critera and aka we increment the left pointer by 1. Once we meet te above critera then we get out the while loop
we next have to update our maximum character result into our res by checking if our current window is greater than our older res window. If it is then
we update it or else we do not. Since we only go through the array only once the Time Complexity is O(n) and the Space Complexity is O(n) because
of the dictonary.
